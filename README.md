# Random-Circuit

Task 4 QC Mentorship program

I have attempted Question 4 Random Circuits.

I have provided two .py (Qiskit) files, one for the generic question and the other for adding the bonus part.
I had a few issues understanding the question, specifically with the basis gates, as a custom backend only supports(U1, U2, U3, CX, id); there is no point in providing it with anything else.
I would have given it more thought or attempted other questions, but unfortunately, my Grandmother passed away recently, and as her direct descendent, I was preoccupied with her last rites and rituals.
Please excuse me if it has hurt my work.

Thank you for having me. It was a wonderful learning experience working on these questions.
